# ALPHABITZ_AI

GOOGLE_CAPSTONE

> **AI evolves language for humanity.**

Solves ambiguity, cliche, misnomer, (polysemy and homonemy) for AI - in a novel way.

____

### OVERVIEW:

This is the story of a language enhancement experiment.

Inspirational vision:

> What if language could be anything?

To set the scene. Let's travel 1,000 years into the future - to year 3025.

> Now join your distant relatives, in a look back at all your YouTubes!

What will they see is antiquated?

> How will AI change us?

Specifically, this capstone explores the study focus of:

> How will AI change LANGUAGE?

____

### THESIS:

> Human language is dynamic.

We can predict that language_dynamism will continue, and will accelerate - with Artificial Intelligence.

This capstone explores this fascinating story!

____

### ORIGIN STORY:

It started in a university dorm room. Where a student imagines a little game to learn C++.

> Use AI to rhyme song lyrics.

With the inspiration of a mentor and a professor - a tokenizer was written for a large language model ~ 25 years ago.

____

### PROBLEMS:

The code was the easy part. The much harder aspect was navigating the "fragility" of the English language.

> It started with the challenge of how to get 'orange' to rhyme with 'door hinge'!

With a paradigm shift to a larger context - waiting as a surprise.

____

### SOLUTIONS:

The first "TEXT_MECHANISM" innovated, was to find similar sounding phonemes.

> It was called: "HARMON_IFICATION".

It was an early agent.

Like 'BSE' token metadata, it was used in the tokenizer to apply "RHYME_ABILITY".

A subtle and powerful concept.

> To rethink language in the age_of_AI.

____

### LANGUAGE PATTERNS:

Inspired by (GoF) DESIGN PATTERNS, the rhyme_ability (MECH), evolved a class of custom AI tools, called text_mechanisms (or MECHZ):

- "NAME_IFICATION"
- "EXACT_IFICATION"
- "CONCEPT_IFICATION"
- "DISAMBIG_IFICATION"

Far beyond rhyming.

These are English words, that reference functional ability for AI.

As decendents of "Harmon_ification".

When AI sees these words - it calls a sub agent to conduct the mechanism.

Like rhyming, or understanding an acronym.

____

### EASY ANALOGY:

Think of "MECHZ" like acronyms.

But with enhanced text patterns.

Also, think of "ALPHABITZ", like an extension to alphabetics - for AI.

____

### INNOVATION:

> The key concept was a crossover of primitives - from computer syntax into English.

It was like giving AI extra_ability, for custom words (called WORDZ).

Inspired by computer science "snake-case", "camel-case", and "title-case" - enhanced syntax was innovated to create TEXT_PRIMITIVES for AI prompts. 

And this became valid, when plain English was fed into Gemini.

But now with "enhanced_english".

____

### PARADIGM SHIFT:

After solving rhyme_ability, a test case was to rhyme CLICHE phrases.

But cliche phrases are notoriously ambiguous to AI. So it was tricky to know what they meant.

A novel solution was innovated apart from web-scraping and scaling.

____


### REAL WORLD VALUE:

With the ability to extend "Text_Mechanisms", new GOALS became:

> "Extra clarity and less confusion."

Also,

> "Create maximum exact text"

And,

> "Index all concepts possible into single words - for AI."

Those sub-agents implemented in this capstone.

____

### DEFINITIONS:

In reverse order:

1. "DISAMBIG_IFICATION" - 
pronounced [dis+am+big+if+ication].

> Solution "MECH" to resolve all ambiguity (called "AMBIGUOSITY").

2. "CONCEPT_IFICATION" -
pronounced [concept+if+ication].

> Index of all concepts, not yet articulated into words - for AI.

3. "EXACT_IFICATION" -
pronounced [exact+if+ication].

> Process for reversing misnomer into self_definitive_principle.

4. "NAME_IFICATION" -
pronounced [name+if+ication].

> Ability for AI to name concepts that are not yet named.

____

### AGENT EXPERIMENTS:

1. CLICHE vs. ALPHABITZ

2. MISNOMER vs. NAMEIFICATION

3. AMBIGUITY vs. EXACTIFICATION

4. CONCEPTIFICATION vs. AMBIGUOSITY
