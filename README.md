# ALPHABITZ_AI

GOOGLE_CAPSTONE

> **AI evolves language for humanity.**

____

### OVERVIEW:

This is the story of a language enhancement experiment.

> What if language could be anything?

What if we could talk to people 1,000 years in the future - and look back at all our YouTubes

What would they say.

> How will AI change us?

Specifically, this capstone explores the study focus of:

> How will AI change LANGUAGE?

____

### THESIS:

> Human language is dynamic.

We can predict that language_dynamism will continue, and accelerate - with Artificial Intelligence.

This capstone shares that fascinating story!

____

### ORIGIN STORY:

It started in a university dorm room. Where a student imagined a simple app to learn C++.

> Use AI to rhyme song lyrics.

With the inspiration of a mentor and a professor, a tokenizer was written for a large laguage model ~ 25 years ago.

____

### PROBLEMS:

The code was the easy part. The much harder aspect was navigating the "fragility" of the English language.

> It started with a fascination of "how to get 'orange' to rhyme with 'door hinge'"?

But a paradigm shift to larger context - was a surprise.

____

### SOLUTIONS:

As the problems cascaded down, from every fragility in English - so too, solutions cascaded out.

For example:

The first "TEXT_MECHANISM" innovated, was used to find similar sounding phonemes.

> It was called: "HARMON_IFICATION".

As token metadata, it was used like a 'BSE' template in the tokenizer to apply "RHYME_ABILITY".

It is a subtle and powerful concept.

> A rethink of language in the age_of_AI.

____

### LANGUAGE PATTERNS:

Inspired by (GoF) DESIGN PATTERNS, the rhyme_ability (MECH), evolved a class of custom AI tools, called text_mechanisms (or MECHZ):

- "NAME_IFICATION"
- "EXACT_IFICATION"
- "CONCEPT_IFICATION"
- "DISAMBIG_IFICATION"

These are English words, that reference functional ability for AI.

And decendents of "Harmon_ification".

____

### EASY ANALOGY:

Think of "MECHZ" like acronyms.

But with enhanced text patterns.

Also, think of "ALPHABITZ", like an extension to alphabetics - for AI.

____

### INNOVATION:

> The key concept was a crossover of syntax - from computer into English.

Inspired by computer science "snake-case", "camel-case", and "title-case" - enhanced syntax was innovated to create TEXT_PRIMITIVES for AI prompts. 

And this became valid, when plain English was fed into Gemini.

____

### REAL WORLD VALUE:

With the ability to extend "Text_Mechanisms", new GOALS became:

> "Extra clarity and less confusion."

Also,

> "Index all concepts possible into single word syntax."

These sub-agents are described in this capstone.

____

### DEFINITIONS:

In reverse order:

1. "DISAMBIG_IFICATION" - 
pronounced [dis+am+big+if+ication].

> Solution "MECH" to resolve all ambiguity (called "AMBIGUOSITY").

2. "CONCEPT_IFICATION" -
pronounced [concept+if+ication].

> Index of all concepts, not yet articulated into words - for AI.

3. "EXACT_IFICATION" -
pronounced [exact+if+ication].

> Process for reversing misnomer into self_definitive_principle.

4. "NAME_IFICATION" -
pronounced [name+if+ication].

> Ability for AI to name concepts that are not yet named.

____

### AGENT EXPERIMENTS:



> As words with "extra_abilities, called "WORDZ" - for AI and humanity.
