GOOGLE_CAPSTONE

> **AI evolves language for humanity.**

____

### OVERVIEW:

This is the story of a language enhancement experiment.

> What if human language could be anything?

Join me for a journey to 1,000 years in the future - for a look back at all our YouTubes!

> How will AI change us?

Specifically, this capstone explores the study focus of:

> How will AI change LANGUAGE?

____

THESIS:

> Human language is dynamic.

We can predict that language_dynamism will continue, and accelerate - with Artificial Intelligence.

This capstone shares that fascinating story!

____

### ORIGIN STORY:

It started in a university dorm room. Where a student imagined a simple app to learn C++.

> Use AI to rhyme song lyrics.

With the help of a mentor and a professor, a tokenizer was written for a large laguage model ~ 25 years ago.

____

### PROBLEMS:

The code was the easy part. The much harder part was understanding a invisible "fragility" in the language.

> It started with a fascination of "how to get 'orange' to rhyme with 'door hinge'"?

____

### SOLUTIONS:

As the problems cascaded out from every fragility in the English language - so too, solutions were found.

The first "TEXT_MECHANISM", was used to find similar sounding phonemes.

> Critically, it was called: "HARMON_IFICATION".

This capstone describes the decendents, that extended from that seminal epiphany.

Inspired by GoF DESIGN PATTERNS, for custom AI tools, called text_mechanisms:

- "NAME_IFICATION"
- "EXACT_IFICATION"
- "CONCEPT_IFICATION"
- "DISAMBIG_IFICATION"

____

### INNOVATION:

The key innovation was a crossover of computer syntax into the English language.

Inspired by computer science "snake-case", "camel-case", and "title-case" - a syntax was innovated to create TEXT_PRIMITIVES. 

> Used like 'BSE' templates in the tokenizer to apply "RHYME_ABILITY".

It is a subtle and powerful concept.

> A rethink of language in the age_of_AI.

The rhyme_ability text, revealed a class of "extra_ability", of enhanced syntax techniques - examined in this capstone.

That paradigm shift was a surprise.

____

### REAL WORLD VALUE:

With the ability to extend "Text_Mechanisms", the GOAL became:

> "extra clarity and less confusion."

These were the mechanisms ("MECHZ"):

- "NAME_IFICATION"
- "EXACT_IFICATION"
- "CONCEPT_IFICATION"
- "DISAMBIG_IFICATION"

These are English words, that reference functional ability in AI.

____

### DEFINITIONS:

In reverse order:

1. "DISAMBIG_IFICATION" - 
pronounced [dis+am+big+if+ication].

> Solution "MECH" to all ambiguity (called "AMBIGUOSITY").

2. "CONCEPT_IFICATION" -
pronounced [concept+if+ication].

> Index of all concepts, not yet articulated into words - for AI.

3. "EXACT_IFICATION" -
pronounced [exact+if+ication].

> Process for reversing misnomer into self_definitive_principle.

4. "NAME_IFICATION" -
pronounced [name+if+ication].

> Ability for AI to name concepts that are not yet named.
